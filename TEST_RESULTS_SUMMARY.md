<details><summary>Test Case 1 — Using 10 as input</summary>


## Test Case 1 — Using 10 as input
### Error Message (what went wrong):
While trying to run test_01_input_prompts, the automated test couldn't complete because your code called an input() function more times than it should have.

### How to fix it:
This error was very likely caused by your code asking for more input() calls than the input test case expected. To see where this is happening in your code, run your code and input THESE EXACT INPUTS IN THIS ORDER (without the quotations):
```
1: "10"
```
Your code should end after all of those inputs have been entered. If, after entering those exact inputs in that order, your code asks for another input, THAT is the cause of this error. You likely wrote an if statement or loop in a way that it is asking for inputs again. Make it so your code doesn't ask for any more inputs after the last input entered. If you believe that is a mistake, please reach out to your professor.



### Having trouble fixing the error messages above?
This test case is entering the inputs listed below with the expectation to get the *exact* same example output shown below. Try running your code using the inputs given below and if your code doesn't match the example output, alter your code until it does. 

Remember, you can always reach out to the TAs, professor, or AI if you need help. If you use AI, it will be better at helping you if you paste in the assignment instructions, your code, and the error message from above.

#### Inputs
The inputs below (without the quotes) will be entered one by one each time an `input()` function is found in your code.
```
1: "10"
```

#### Example Output
This is what your terminal should look like if you use the inputs above when running your code.
```
Please enter a whole number: 10
10 divided by 2 is 5.0
```
