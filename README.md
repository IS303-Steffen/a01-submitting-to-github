#### Assignment 2
# Submitting to Github
The primary purpose of this assignment is to practice:
1. Running tests on your code, and
2. Uploading your assignments to GitHub

You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com) or read [this tutorial](https://www.google.com) for instructions on both of those. The actual code you will write and submit just involves gathering inputs, doing simple math, and printing out some statements. Put your code in the ***a2_submitting_to_github.py*** file. Do not edit or delete any other files.

## Logical Flow
1. Before doing any of this, make sure you watch the video linked above, or read the instructions so you understand how to run the tests included with the assignment and how to turn the assignment in.
2. Using the ***input()*** function, ask the user:
    - > Please enter a whole number: 
    - Assume that the user will always enter a valid whole number.
    - Store the number in a variable
3. Convert the number to an ***int*** datatype.
4. Print out the message:
    - >*number* divided by 2 is *new_number*
    - But with actual values. For example, if the user entered *10*, then the message should display as:
    - > 10 divided by 2 is 5

Be sure to include comments in your code. Push your code to your GitHub repository in order to receive credit for the assignment
